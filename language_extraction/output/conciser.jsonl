I hate getting caught reading About That, especially by its creator.\nI lower my phone and slam my locker shut. “Whose lives are you ruining\nnext, Simon?”\nSimon falls into step beside me as I move against the flow of students\nheading for the exit. “It’s a public service,” he says with a dismissive wave.\n“You tutor Reggie Crawley, don’t you? Wouldn’t you rather know he has a\ncamera in his bedroom?”\nI don’t bother answering. Me getting anywhere near the bedroom of\nperpetual stoner Reggie Crawley is about as likely as Simon growing a\nconscience.\n“Anyway, they bring it on themselves. If people didn’t lie and cheat, I’d\nbe out of business.” Simon’s cold blue eyes take in my lengthening strides.\n“Where are you rushing off to? Covering yourself in extracurricular glory?”\nI wish.
